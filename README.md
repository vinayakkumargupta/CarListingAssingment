# CarListingAssingment
This is Assignment Given By Scouto

Hello, my name is Vinayak Kumar Gupta, and I am currently pursuing my B.Tech from Bennett University. I am a third-year student with a keen interest in Android development and data analysis.

Recently, I was tasked by Scouto to build an Android application using Java and XML. The requirements included building a login/signup page using SQLite and Room, as well as a dashboard with dropdown menus where users can select the makes and models of cars. I am pleased to share that I have fulfilled all the requirements as instructed.

For the login/signup page, I used SQLite to store all user data locally. I also created a dashboard with dropdown menus and incorporated Restful API #1 and #2 as instructed. Additionally, I added a "your cars" section where users can add photos and log out from the dashboard.

To enhance the user interface, I utilized various tools such as RecyclerView, LinearLayout, and CardView. Moreover, I successfully parsed the make_name from the given JSON link.

Please find attached a screenshot of the application. Thank you for your time and consideration.
